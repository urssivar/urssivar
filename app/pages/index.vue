            We collect words, record stories, build family trees, and take DNA tests.
            <strong>Time is running out</strong> — this is our last chance to preserve what remains.
            Every forgotten word, every abandoned village, every lost lineage is one less fragment of our heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're not just preserving memory. We're preparing materials for future Kaitag research.
            With enough data, linguists will be able to classify dialects and understand how our language
            sounded in the past, while geneticists will show where legends about village origins align with DNA evidence
            and reconstruct the ancient history of our people. All of this depends <strong>on us.</strong>
        </p>

            We're recording living Kaitag speech and building an archive of original texts: tales, stories, songs,
            proverbs —
            everything that will be lost forever if we don't capture it now, while the last generation of speakers is
            still alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Dictionary:</strong> The most complete lexical database of the Kaitag language by villages and
            micro-regions.
            A base corpus of 5,000 words has been collected; the dictionary now expands through contributions from
            native speakers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Oral texts:</strong> Natural Kaitag speech — stories, memories, descriptions of daily life and
            traditions,
            dialogues and prayers. This preserves not only vocabulary, but also patterns of thought, speech style, and
            culture.

        <p>
            We compile Kaitag family trees — names, lifespans, villages of origin, and migration patterns.
            We also use DNA testing to establish ancient origins and kinship connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Family trees:</strong> We trace lineages backward through generations, as far as memory allows,
            documenting years of life, native villages, and migrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DNA tests:</strong> Genetics provides precise answers — confirming or refuting genealogies and
            showing the degree of kinship between families. We work with FamilyTreeDNA laboratory (USA),
            using Y-chromosomal analysis (paternal line) and autosomal testing (general ancestry)
            to reconstruct branches within clans and study migrations and connections between villages.
