        <h2>What This Is For</h2>
        <p>
            We collect words, record stories, build family trees, take DNA tests.
            Because <strong>time is running out</strong>, and now is the <strong>last chance</strong> to preserve this.
            Every forgotten word, every abandoned village, every lost lineage — that's one less fragment of our
            heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we're not just preserving memory. We're preparing materials for future Kaitag research.
            If we gather enough data: linguists will be able to classify dialects and understand how our language
            sounded in the past;
            geneticists will show where legends about village origins align with DNA data and reconstruct the ancient
            history of our people.
        </p>
        <p>And all of this depends <strong>on us.</strong></p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h3>
            <NuxtLink to="https://codex.urssivar.com">Kaitag Language</NuxtLink>
        </h3>
        <p>
            We record living Kaitag speech by villages and compile dictionaries by village groups.
            We're building an archive of original texts: tales, stories, songs, proverbs — everything that will be lost
            forever
            if we don't capture it now, while the last generation of speakers is still alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Dictionary:</strong> We're building the most complete lexical database of the Kaitag language by
            villages and micro-regions.
            A base corpus of 5,000 words has been collected; now the dictionary expands through data from native
            speakers themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Oral texts:</strong> We capture natural Kaitag speech — stories, memories, descriptions of daily
            life and traditions,
            dialogues and prayers. This preserves not only vocabulary, but also thinking, speech style, and culture.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <NuxtLink to="https://www.familytreedna.com/groups/kaitag/about">Genealogy</NuxtLink>
        </h3>
        <p>
            We compile Kaitag family trees: who was named what, what years they lived, where they migrated from.
            We also take DNA tests to establish ancient origins and kinship connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Family trees:</strong> We record family trees — from living people upward, as far as memory allows.
            We document years of life, native village, migrations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DNA tests:</strong> Genetics provides precise answers — confirms or refutes genealogies,
            shows the degree of kinship between families and the depth of their origins. We work with FamilyTreeDNA
            laboratory (USA),
            using Y-chromosomal analysis (paternal line) and autosomal testing (general ancestry).
            This allows reconstructing branches within clans, studying migrations and connections between villages.
