# Urssivar: Kaitag Studies

_Наллара дел да. Ьам ра бел._ {lang=xdq}

We collect words, record stories, restore family trees, and conduct DNA testing.
**Time is running out** — this is the last chance to preserve what remains.
Every forgotten word, every lost lineage is a fragment of heritage that will disappear forever.

We're building a foundation for future research on Kaitag.
With enough data, linguists will be able to classify dialects and understand how the language
developed,
while geneticists can verify legends about village origins and reconstruct the ancient history of
the
people.
All of this depends **on us.**

<!-- ## <ULink to="https://codex.urssivar.com">Kaitag Language</ULink> -->

We're recording living Kaitag speech and creating an archive of original texts: tales, stories,
songs,
proverbs —
everything that will disappear forever without documentation now, while the last generation of
speakers
is
still alive.

**Dictionary:** A lexical database of the Kaitag language by villages and
micro-regions.
Base corpus of 5,000 words, expanding through contributions from native speakers.

**Oral texts:** Natural speech — stories, memories, descriptions of daily life and
traditions,
dialogues, prayers. We document not only vocabulary, but also patterns of thought, speech style, and
culture.

We compile family trees — names, lifespans, villages, migrations.
We use DNA testing to establish origins and kinship connections.

**Family trees:** We trace lineages backward through generations, documenting years of
life,
villages, and migrations.

**DNA tests:** Genetics confirms or refutes genealogies and shows the degree of kinship
between
families.
We work with FamilyTreeDNA laboratory (USA), using Y-chromosomal analysis (paternal line) and
autosomal
testing (general ancestry).
This allows us to reconstruct branches within clans, study migrations, and trace connections between
villages.
