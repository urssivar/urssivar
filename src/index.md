# Urssivar: Kaitag Studies

++_Наллара дел да. Ьам ра бел._++

Reclaiming the legacy of the Kaitag people of Dagestan. The race against time to preserve what remains before it vanishes forever.

This data becomes the foundation for understanding Kaitag. With sufficient volume, linguists can classify dialects and trace how the language developed, while geneticists can verify village origin legends and reconstruct the ancient history of the people.

There's much to be done.

## [Kaitag Language](./language/)

To preserve the Kaitag language, we document it in its living form — through words and speech. What we don't capture now, while the last generation of speakers is alive, will be lost irretrievably.

**Dictionary:** Building the most complete lexical database across villages and dialects. Every word, variant, and form matters.

**Oral texts:** Recording natural speech — tales, memories, dialogues, prayers. Preserving not just sound, but mentality and culture.

## [Kaitag Genealogy](./genealogy/)

To understand our origins and how Kaitag families connect, we trace lineages through legends and DNA analysis. Together, they reveal who our ancestors were and how villages are related.

**Family trees:** Recording names, lifespans, migrations, and kinship networks. Every family story adds to the larger picture.

**DNA analysis:** Y-chromosomal and autosomal testing through FamilyTreeDNA. Verifying oral traditions, revealing ancestral connections, and reconstructing our past.
