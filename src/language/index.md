# [Urssivar](../index#kaitag-language): Kaitag Language

Kaitag is a language of the Dargwic branch of the Northeast Caucasian family. In the early 20th century, it was spoken in 56 mountain villages across nine historical microregions in southern Dagestan.

In 1938, Soviet language planning reclassified Kaitag from an independent language to a dialect â€” a decision driven by policy rather than science. The subsequent shift in school education and ethnic identification left people struggling and voiceless. No Kaitag infrastructure was developed and no literary tradition emerged. The language remained largely undocumented.

Natural transmission has now ceased. Fluent speakers are concentrated among the elderly. Much has been lost, but we are recording what remains while speakers are still here. Any help is much needed and welcome.
