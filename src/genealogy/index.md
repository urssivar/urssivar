# [Urssivar](../index#kaitag-genealogy): Kaitag Genealogy

The Kaitags are an indigenous ethnic group of Dagestan whose language belongs to the Dargwic branch of the Northeast Caucasian family.

The Kaitag ethnic zone extends from the Caspian lowlands to the mountains along the Ulluchay River in southern Dagestan. In the early 20th century, 58 mountain villages formed six historical regions. Kaitags border the closely related Dargins and Kubachins to the northwest, the Lezgic peoples (Tabasarans and Aghuls) to the southwest, and Turkic populations (Kumyks and Terkemens) to the east. Historically, there was also a significant Juhuri (Mountain Jewish) population.

For centuries, Kaitag territory stood at the strategic frontier between empires — Persian, Ottoman, Russian — and the mountain peoples. This position at the crossroads of civilizations, controlling parts of the Caspian trade routes, shaped Kaitags into a distinctive part of the Caucasian mosaic.
