# [Urssivar](../index#kaitag-genealogy): Kaitag Genealogy

The Kaitags are an indigenous ethnic group of Dagestan whose language belongs to the Dargwic branch of the Northeast Caucasian family.

The Kaitag ethnic zone extends from the Caspian lowlands to the mountains along the Ulluchay River in southern Dagestan. In the early 20th century, 56 mountain villages formed nine historical microregions. Kaitags border closely related Dargins and Kubachins to the northwest, Lezgic peoples (Tabasarans and Aghuls) to the southwest, and Turkic populations (Kumyks and Terekeme) to the east. Historically, there was also a significant Juhuri (Mountain Jewish) population.

For centuries, Kaitag stood at the strategic frontier between empires — Persian, Ottoman, Russian — and the mountain peoples. This position at the crossroads of civilizations, access to Caspian trade routes, and the region's diverse ethnic composition shaped Kaitags into a distinctive part of the East Caucasian mosaic.
