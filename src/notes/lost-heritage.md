# Lost Heritage

My grandmother was from ++Ҡерҡай++. She was raised by her own grandmother who lived over 100 years and who the people of ++Ирчьамул++ called _"great mother"_. That's why, my mother was telling, my grandmother knew so much.

It has been 19 years since my grandmother died, may God forgive her sins. We preserved nothing of her: no stories, no proverbs, no songs. Drinking and eating, we lost everything in vain.

Now the village is gone, and no one left to ask, like, what was our name for that plant?
